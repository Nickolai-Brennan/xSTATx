## 📖 Overview

**ProspeX** is a dynamic tracking model to evaluate **prospects** beyond standard **top-100 lists**.  
Rather than only ranking by reputation, **ProspeX** scores players using:

- 40% Current Year MiLB Stats
- 10% Previous Year MiLB Stats
- 50% Scouting Research Blend (Tools, Grade Adjustments, Reports)

This system is meant to:
- Identify **hidden gems** before they break out.
- Quantify **risk factors** like K-BB%, Zone% Issues, Age vs Level mismatch.
- Project **early MLB impact opportunities** based on team needs.

## ⚙️ Scoring Methodology

ProspeX Score =

```text
(0.40 × Current Year Stats) + (0.10 × Prior Year Stats) + (0.50 × Scouting Research Composite)
```

  - wRC+, K%, BB%, ISO, xFIP (for pitchers), age vs level adjustment
- **Prior Year Stats**:
  - Same metrics but weighted lower for trend verification
- **Scouting Research Composite**:
  - Tool grades (Hit, Power, Arm, Run, Field, Stuff, Command)
  - Projected MLB readiness
  - Organizational path and depth chart
