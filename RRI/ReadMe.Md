# 🔵 Reliever Reliability Index (RRI)

Real-time bullpen pitcher evaluations based on advanced metrics.  
The **RRI Score** measures bullpen reliability by combining role, performance, leverage usage, durability, prospect status, and team context.  
Scored dynamically from **25 to 125+** to reflect true player value.

## 📖 Overview

The **Reliever Reliability Index (RRI)** is a proprietary rating system for MLB relief pitchers.  
It measures bullpen pitcher reliability across multiple dimensions:
- Performance metrics (ERA, xFIP, K/BB, WHIP, CSW%)
- Leverage usage (aLI, pLI, gmLI)
- Saves, Holds, Inherited Runners
- Prospect status & role sustainability
- Injury history & durability
- Trade rumors & team context

The goal is to provide **fantasy players**, **analysts**, and **teams** a **modernized, trustworthy** bullpen depth map.

## 📈 Data Sources

| Source | Usage Purpose |
|:-------|:--------------|
| FanGraphs | Pitcher advanced stats (xFIP, K%, BB%, leverage) |
| Baseball Savant | Statcast metrics (velocity, spin rate, hard hit %) |
| Baseball Reference | Durability, historical IL stints |
| MLB.com / Team Pages | Current bullpen roles, roster moves |
| xSTATx Internal | Prospect badges, trade rumor trackers |

## ⚙️ Scoring Methodology

RRI Score =  

```text
(0.25 × Previous Year’s RRI) + (0.50 × Current Season Performance) + (0.25 × Non-Playing Factors)
```

Where:
- **Current Season** =  
    - 30% Performance Metrics (ERA, xFIP, K%, K/BB, CSW%)
    - 20% Leverage Usage Score (aLI, pLI, gmLI)
    - 15% Saves and Holds (SV%, HLD%, IR%)
    - 15% Stuff Quality Score (Stuff+, Location+, Pitching+)
    - 10% Batted Ball Metrics (HardHit%, Soft%)
    - 10% Clutch and Inherited Runners

- **Non-Playing Factors** =  
    - Prospect Status (Top 100, MiLB Awards)
    - Injury Field (LT IL, consistent IL stints, elbow issues)
    - Team Contention Level
    - Player Role Type (Closer, Setup, High-Leverage Relief)
    - Age Scale Adjustment (post-37 declines)

## 🏆 RRI Score Tiers

| Tier | RRI Range | Description |

| 🥉 Tier 6 – Solid Veteran | 70–79 | Trusted arms, reliable |
| 🛡️ Tier 5 – Middle Relief | 55–69 | Role secure but inconsistent |
| ⚠️ Tier 4 – Risky | 40–54 | Mop-up, injury-prone, poor metrics |
| ❌ Tier 3 – Replacement Level | 25–39 | Likely to be DFA’d, MiLB depth |

# ✨ Next Up:

I can now build the others:

- `/ProspeX/README.md`
- `/FBCS3/README.md`
- `/Strik3_Reports/README.md`

Would you like me to keep this same **tight clean style** and build `/ProspeX/README.md` next?  
(If yes, I’ll customize it for your prospect weighting model: 40% Current, 10% Prior, 50% Scout Blend.)  

Ready to roll? 🎯🚀
